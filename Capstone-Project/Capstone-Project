About this project

This capstone project be about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. 

We will make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world.

It will require to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code.

Using Python and its pandas library to manipulate data will help me refine skills for exploring and analyzing data.

Finally, the Folium library will be used to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate the results and findings.
